# Staking

Staking is the process of locking up your assets (in this case FURY) in order to validate transactions on the blockchain. Users who choose to stake will be able to obtain rewards as a result of that process. 

Enigma follows a proof-of-stake mechanism, in which users can stake their tokens to certain Enigma validators who will do the work of validating transactions, while the user reaps the benefit through only contributing assets.

## Stake FURY

Stake your FURY to a validator to start earning rewards.

## Withdraw staking rewards

Rewards start accruing the moment you stake FURY. Monitor your rewards in the staking section of Enigma Hub. Once you have earned a sufficient amount of rewards, you may withdraw them at any time.

## Redelegate

Redelegating lets you transfer staked FURY from one validator to another without waiting the 21-day unstaking period. Redelegating happens instantly.

## Undelegate

Undelegating FURY is the process of unstaking your assets from a validator. The unstaking period takes 21 days to complete.
