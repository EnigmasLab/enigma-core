# Wallet

Enigma Wallet allows you to monitor your assets on Enigma. Assets can be native tokens on Enigma, as well as bridged assets from Ethereum, Moonbeam and various IBC-enabled chains.

You can also send assets to other Enigma wallets using the wallet. Note that Enigma supports the `memo` field, so please be reminded to check whether your recipient requires this detail to be filled before transferring assets.
