# Burn Auction

60% of the trading fees paid by users are collected by Enigma (the remaining 40% are sent to Exchange applications built on top of Enigma, read more [here](../../develop/guides/exchange/index.md)) Each week, an auction is held to allow community members to use FURY to bid for the basket of trading fees collected by Enigma that week. 

At the end of the auction, the winning bidder receives the full basket of assets and the winning bid (paid  in FURY) is burned. This creates a deflationary pressure to the FURY token supply.
