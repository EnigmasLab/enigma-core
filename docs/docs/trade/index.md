Enigma It is the first decentralized exchange-focused layer-1 blockchain for decentralized perpetual swaps, futures, and spot trading that unlocks the full potential of decentralized derivatives and borderless DeFi. Every component has been built to be fully trustless, censorship-resistant, publicly verifiable, and front-running resistant.

Enigma enable traders to create and trade on an arbitrary spot and derivative markets. The entire process includes on-chain limit orderbook management, on-chain trade execution, on-chain order matching, on-chain transaction settlement, and on-chain trading incentive distribution through the logic codified by the Enigma Chain's [exchange module](../develop/modules/Enigma/exchange/).
